# Tweaking TypeScript

This repo holds my little brittle projects I made during learning
typescript.

1. ## [Annotations](./annotations)

Annotations contains some typescript way of working with arrays,objects, interfaces, tuples, variables, classes and functions.

### Set up

Install TypeScript and ts-node globally using
`npm i -g typescript ts-node`

### Run any file using:

`ts-node filename.ts`
