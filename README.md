# Tweaking TypeScript

This repo holds my little brittle projects I made during learning
typescript.

---

## 1. [Annotations](./annotations)

Annotations contains some typescript way of working with arrays,objects, interfaces, tuples, variables, classes and functions.

### Set up

Install TypeScript and ts-node globally using
`npm i -g typescript ts-node`

### Run any file using:

`ts-node filename.ts`

---

## 2. [FetchJson](./features)

Fetch Json uses **JSONPlaceHolder** api to demostrate typeScript way of working with Api's.

### Set up

`npm install`

`npm install -g typescript ts-node`

Run index.ts using `ts-node index.ts` to call the API.

---

## 3. [Maps](./maps)

Maps demonstrate a modular approch of working with google maps in typeScript by utilizing interfaces and classes.

### Set Up

`npm install && npm run dev`

---

## 4. [Sort](./sort)

Here, I made use of abstract classes to define a contract b/w sorter and any other data structure utilizing sorter.

### Set up

`npm install && npm start`

---

## 5. [Stats](./stats)

Stats uses a football.csv file to read a chunks of data and then utilizes object oriented potential of typeScript and Generics to perform analysis on that data.

### Set up

`npm install && npm start`
